# Snapchat's Lens Studio Target Practice Example Project

# Throw a snowball in Snapchat's Lens Studio!

# Overview

The following is an example project that I've built entirely in Lens Studio. The user taps their screen in order to throw a snowball at a stationary target, a simple cube in this case, based on the position of an arrow that moves horizontally. Currently, all you'll see happen is a "Hit" or a "Miss" logged accordingly, as well as the current position of the snowball as it is thrown.

# Example

I built this script while working on Sony's Goosebumps 2 "Snowball fight with Slappy" game they release over christmas 2018. There weren't any resources at the time for building this type of interactivity. Check it out using the link below!

# Getting Started

Simply clone this repo and open the .lsproj file. Lens Studio can be a bit finicky when it comes to interacting with git, but you should recieve all of the proper scripts, graphics, etc... 

Feel free to send any questions or concerns my way! Don't be afraid to fork and submit PRs with any improvements either!!
